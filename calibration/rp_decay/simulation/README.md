# rp-decay Simulation

The files in this directory aim to simulate as accurately as possible the process of the photon counting calibration protocol done by the ```rp_decay_standalone.py``` script with the RedPitaya.
The objective is to compare the data generated by the simulation with the data generated by the RP, so that data artifacts can be awarded to the pulse generation logic or the pulse emission by the RP hardware.
